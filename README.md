# B'nei Mikra Application

**BeneiMikra** is an open-source front-end project created to share, preserve, and providing accurate information on Karaite Jewish beliefs, culture, and traditions — directly from a Karaite perspective. 
This initiative is both personal and communal: it's my own journey as a Torah-loving Karaite, and an invitation for others to contribute. 
This project invites Karaite and non-Karaite alike to explore our way of life without distortion, misrepresentation, or Rabbinic bias.

For too long, Karaite Judaism has been explained by outsiders who often mischaracterize or diminish our practices. 
**BeneiMikra** aims to change that. It is a tool to **educate**, **connect**, and **inspire** through insights and Karaite teachings.

## 🔹 What the app will include:
- **Personal Essays & Reflections**  
  On Torah living, challenges faced by converts, diaspora identity, and walking a Karaite path in modern times.

- **Karaite Authority Consensus**  
  Clarity on halakhic matters as agreed upon by the recognized Karaite institutions and scholars.

- **Blessing Book**  
  Karaite blessings with guidance, structure, and purpose... How many time have you been on to go without your blessing book?

- **Educational Guides**  
  How to make **tzitzit**, **count the omer**, observe **Shabbat**, and more.

- **Holiday Guide**  
  Step-by-step explanations of the **Karaite calendar** and holidays, made simple and direct.

- **Daily/Weekly/Monthly Torah Integration**  
  Future support for a **calendar** that integrates Torah portions, omer counting, and feast preparation reminders.

This project is a growing expression of a living tradition — not a museum piece. 
It's built with love for the Torah and a desire to help others navigate, question, and embrace a Karaite Jewish life.

If you're Karaite, may this deepen your understanding.  
If you're not, may this offer you an honest window into who we truly are.

> "We are not Rabbinic. We are not a sect. We are Israelites seeking Torah truth — directly from Scripture as B'nei Mikra (Children of the Scriptures)."
